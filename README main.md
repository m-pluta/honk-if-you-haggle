# Honk if you haggle

This is my attempt at a responsive website designed using Bootstrap during university for buying used cars.

I could not not find the CDN for the Bootstrap Bare template so thats why this project is 70% CSS. 

## Installation

Clone the repo and execute `npm i` in the terminal in the main directory.

Then run `npm run start` in the terminal to launch the node server. The website should launch at http://127.0.0.1:8080
